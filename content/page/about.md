Hello, my name is Michelle Ragsac! I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego (Class of 2017) studying **Bioengineering with a specialization in Bioinformatics**. 

At my university, I'm an active member of several student organizations, including [The Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES)](http://bmes.ucsd.edu) and [The Undergraduate Bioinformatics Club (UBIC)](http://ubic.ucsd.edu). For both BMES and UBIC, I've held several officer positions[^n]. I'm also involved in on-campus research and am curently interested in studying neurodegenerative diseases!

[^n]: BMES, (2015-16) Vice-President Internal, (2014-15) Lab Expo Chair & Publicity/Webmaster; UBIC, (2015-16) External Officer

In my spare time, I enjoy taking pictures of my food on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/isoforms), as well as watching anime! I also have the superpower to fall asleep whenever I get the chance to.

Also, feel free to [email me](mailto:mragsac@eng.ucsd.edu)!
