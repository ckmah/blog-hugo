In my spare time, I like taking pictures--not just of my food, but also of people[^n]! In college, this hobby was translated into taking pictures at the many events hosted by the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) when I was the Publicity/Webmaster chair, as well as taking photos of graduating seniors. 

I've attached a few samples of a few I took this past week! 

[^n]: I know that this isn't related to my study abroad trip to Japan this summer, but I wanted to add these pictures here.

> For taking pictures of **Alice**, we traveled to La Jolla Shores and the Torrey Pines Gliderport! The sun was really bright this day and the wind was pretty strong. We were also able to take a lot of silly photos, which was great!

> When I took pictures of **Lisa and Heather**, the sky was incredibly overcast! It made the light very soft and I struggled to add some life back into their skin... but overall, the pictures looked great! We went to the Scripp's Pier and walked around Geisel Library on the UC San Diego campus.

The majority of the people I hang out with are seniors, and all of them will be graduating in two weeks. I'm very excited for all of them, but I can't help but be a bit sad because they're leaving.

I think that the one group that I'll miss most is the group of bioinformatics students that are one year older than me--Clarence, Zack, Heather, and David! They've given me a lot of advice for my classes and getting through the curriculum, and they're one of the closest groups of friends that I have. 

Fortunately, I was able to take a few photos of them as well--I'll post those another time.
