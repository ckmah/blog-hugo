Hello, my name is Michelle Ragsac! I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego (Class of 2017) studying **Bioengineering with a specialization in Bioinformatics**. 

At my university, I'm an active member of several student organizations, including [The Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES)](http://bmes.ucsd.edu) and [The Undergraduate Bioinformatics Club (UBIC)](http://ubic.ucsd.edu). For both BMES and UBIC, I've held several officer positions[^n]. I'm also involved in on-campus research and am curently interested in studying neurodegenerative diseases!

[^n]: BMES, (2015-16) Vice-President Internal, (2014-15) Lab Expo Chair & Publicity/Webmaster; UBIC, (2015-16) External Officer

In my spare time, I enjoy taking pictures of my food on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/isoforms), as well as watching anime! I also have the superpower to fall asleep whenever I get the chance to.

#### **Why Blogging?**

During high school, I kept a Tumblr blog to compile posts I found interesting, pictures I thought looked cool, and pieces of writing I wrote myself. I kind of stopped maintaining that site during college because I got distracted by classes and hanging out with friends.

However the chance to start (re-)posting content online has pushed me to learn how to manage my own static blog using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io)! That chance was being offered to study abroad as part of [UCEAP's Summer Engineering and Science Lab Research Program](http://eap.ucop.edu/OurPrograms/japan/Pages/summer_lab_research_engineering_science.aspx) that is hosted by Osaka University's [FrontierLabs Program](http://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/international/inbound/exchange_program/frontierlab/frontierlabguide). Through this blog, I hope to document my experiences leading up to my internship, travelling and exploring Japan, and maybe throughout my senior year of college---if I still maintain this site then!

#### **What will be posted?**

I hope to keep this blog like a journal of my experiences to show pictures that I take, and thoughts that I have as a foreigner researching overseas. I guess the "formal" term is a *lifestyle* blog.

Stay tuned!
