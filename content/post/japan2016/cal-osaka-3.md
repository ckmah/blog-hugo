I've been caught up in all of the events going on recently so I'm *very* behind on all of my posts! To give you the lowdown, I think I'll be posting less and less and what I'm actually working on in lab unless there's anything significant because it's the same each day for the most part. I'm still doing SQL queries and analyzing the results for them. 

Now, onwards with more posts! 

### Sunday, June 26th

We all had to wake up pretty early the next day to leave **Kinosakionsen**! But before we left, we had one last gourmet breakfast---well, it didn't seem like a breakfast that we were used to. There was so much food! Too much food! I think most of us struggled to finish every single piece of fish, rice---you name it---that was placed in front of us.

Once again, the placement of everything was very nice! To identify things that aren't very distinguishable (the watermelon in the green bowl also had some orange slices), in the white bowl, there was **daikon** saturated in some sort of tangy sauce. And then in the brown wooden bowl, there was tofu that you were supposed to eat with soy sauce. There was sliced squid in the blue bowl---that I didn't fancy too much. And finally, there was dipping sauce for our soba noodles in the black container.

Look at all the food! All of us were very groggy---and some grumpy. 

Now that it's in view, inside the pot (with the wooden lid), there was thinly-sliced beef and bean sprouts. Everything inside the pot was being cooked by the flame of a candle underneath! Super delicious!

After we ate, a few of us left a little earlier than the group to explore the town for a little bit. I was able to purchase some **omiyages** for my labmates! I purchased different types of cakes and other snacks that you eat with tea---my lab really loves their tea, so I thought it would be a fitting gift. 

Everything on this last day in Kinosaki was rushed because we woke up a little too late to explore. We were all supposed to wake up at six o'clock in the morning to get one more dip into the hot spring, but most of us ended up sleeping through our alarms to wake up at eight instead.

And just like that, the weekend was over and I had to go back to **Yamada Station** by myself to rest before going into lab the next day. The rest of the group had to go back to **Tokyo**; they were there for two more days before flying to Hong Kong (24 hour layover) and then back to San Francisco! Everything during this weekend was very exciting and I'm really glad that I was able to tag along on the trip with everybody!  Once I got back, I looked over prices to see if it would be possible to go again---everything was already booked! The only rooms available were the ones in very expensive hotels! 

I think the next time I come to Japan---I assure you, it will happen---I will make sure to stop by again!
