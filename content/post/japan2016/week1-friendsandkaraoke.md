### Wednesday, June 22nd

For lab, I rewrote what I made on Tuesday to make everything more efficient! I'm starting to get the hang of making SQL queries and extracting what information I want out of the PDBj. How I code right now is still a bit rugged, but I think with time and practice, it will end up being okay. Otherwise, everything is the same old, same old: come in at around 9:00am, sit at my desk and do work (lots of Googling and figuring out syntax for what I want to do), eat lunch with the younger lab mates after purchasing food from the nearby kombini, and then work until I feel like going home at around 5:00pm.

I feel like this first week is left for understanding the material and making sure I have a handle on things before jumping into anything larger. 

In the evening, I was able to meet up with my friends from California (again)! After a snafu on the **Osaka Municipal Subway**---which was extremely confusing to navigate when I first got off at the stop---I made it to **Shinsaibashi**, the largest shopping area in Osaka!

Right when I got out of the station, it was rainy and very gloomy. So many people in Japan use the clear umbrellas! Here, they're only about 400-500 yen (approximately $4.00 to $5.00), but when you try to purchase them in the States, they're more than that! While waiting for the rest of the group, a few of my friends and I were sitting underneath the overhang of a Louis Vuitton store. I wish I could dress as stylish as people here in Osaka.

I wasn't able to take pictures inside the actual shopping arcade because it started raining pretty heavily, I didn't have my mirrorless camera, and my phone was running out of battery! But it was very pretty and *extremely packed* with people---I hope to go again sometime, especially when I looking for souvenirs to bring back home. Most of the stores there are "Tax Free", meaning that if you purchase a certain amount of goods, you do not have to pay any tax if you bring your passport!

After wandering for a bit, we were all pretty hungry. Because our group of eleven people was *way* too much for restaurants to handle, we split up. My group ended up going to a **yakiniku joint**.

So much better than Gyu-kaku back home! We actually ordered a lot of food, but I kept getting impatient and eating everything that was put on my plate without taking pictures---whoops.

### Thursday, June 23rd

Today in lab, I finished what I was assigned---a week ahead of schedule? I sent all of my results and analysis to my mentor and I'm waiting on him to look it over and provide any feedback, or what I could possibly start doing next. So far, he seems satisfied with what I'm sending over. I also made and then gave a presentation about what I've done so far! People seemed pretty impressed, considering my nonexistent experience in protein informatics or database stuffs when I first started.

Other than the work part, my lab mates are starting to open up more and we talk freely at lunch without any awkward pauses! Right now, they want to take me on a trip to **Kyoto** on July 3rd, **Korean BBQ** on August 8th, and a **Beer Party** with the entire lab on August 8th! I'm so excited to go! Some of them have also watched the same anime that I've watched, and they were surprised that I can even *access* anime and manga back in the States, as well as get good Asian food there.

You know how in the last post I said that I didn't have a cubby to place my shoes into? I actually do now! And I have my own pair of indoor slippers. They were actually waiting until I could get my own pair to use for the summer.

My name tag was also placed everywhere! I think it's kind of silly that my name is so long so they include my name, as well as the translation into hiragana. There's always an icon afterwards as well---it's either a cute dog or a cute cat icon!

After lab, I went out to dinner and then karaoke with friends at **カラオケほっとBB北千里駅前店** at the **Hankyu Railway's Kita-Senri Station**! It was a struggle to find the English songs at first, but after that, it seemed like everybody had fun! I'm really sad that I forgot to take a picture of my dinner though---I had some really delicious grilled mackerel. We sang a lot of pop songs, as well as tried our hand at singing anime openings. I definitely want to go again next time with everybody, especially since we know where it's located now and nobody will get lost.

For karaoke, you can rent a room by the hour to share with your friends! Non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary, and you can also purchase appetizers, entrees, desserts, and alcoholic drinks. The seven of us stayed there for three hours, ordered a multitude of alcoholic drinks and food, and everything ended up being around 8000 yen total---not bad, considering it was peak time! Last time I went to a karaoke place near UC San Diego, I had to contribute *a lot* just to stay for an hour. And no drinks!
