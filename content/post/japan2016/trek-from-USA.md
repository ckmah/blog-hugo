I'm supposed to be leaving to go to my program's orientation in two hours, but I can't fall asleep because of the jet lag---and the headache that formed because the previous person that used my hotel room smoked in it.

I'm currently staying at the **Toyoko Inn: Osaka Itami Kuko**, which is across the street from the Osaka International Airport (ITM).

### The Flight, SFO to YVR to KIX

I booked all my international flights between Osaka and San Francisco with Air Canada because they had the best deals when I was purchasing tickets. Unfortunately, all of my flights are at Kansai International Airport (KIX) instead of the Osaka International Airport (ITM) that is closer to where I'll be staying during my two month journey.

One of the plus sides of booking Air Canada was that I was able to practice reading French at my layover in Vancouver (YVR), as well as trying to understand what people were saying when they were talking over the intercom---is that what it's called? I actually took the equivalent of four years of French to fulfill my foreign language requirement in high school, but I haven't practiced really since I graduated in 2013. 

During my **flight from SFO to YVR**, I spent most of my time editing senior photos for my friend Jess---at least, until I ran out of space on my external hard drive? 500 GB went by so fast! I'll be looking for a new one here at an electronics store, I guess---I'll be needing one anyways. I also left my iPad at home, and I forgot I loaded all of my movies, games, and papers to read onto it. *Oh well.* I have my laptop to use while I'm here! 

The **layover at YVR** was really cool! I've never been to the Vancouver Airport, but I loved the interior because there was lots of natural light, nature displays, and even a fish tank with fish as large as my head! By the time people started arriving at my gate, the fact that I was going to a foreign country really hit me---I started getting really nervous because I didn't know how to speak the language, didn't know exactly how to get from point A to point B, and didn't know anybody going there at the same time as me in my program. 

Luckily, I saw a few people wearing UC apparel: UCEAP t-shirts, UCLA sweaters, and more! I spoke to a few of the other students, but some of them were part of other programs different from my own.

Finally, the **flight from YVR to KIX** was very tiring and long---but mostly tiring. The downside was that I had a rowdy bunch of Japanese teenage boys sitting behind me, and that there weren't any televisions to use. The plus side was that I had an entire row of seats to myself (I sat beside the window) in a Boeing 727, and there was an outlet available! We were also served three different meals/snacks:

1. Gyu-don with vegetables, a miniature bread loaf, vegetable salad, and brownie
2. The most intense chocolate chip cookie I've ever had---there was barely any cookie, it was all chocolate
3. A philly cheesesteak sandwich with cashews on the side

I also got confused as somebody's daughter until they realized that I couldn't speak Japanese, so that was fun. I've never seen somebody apologize to me so much in my life.

Even though the plane ride was ten hours, I could barely fall asleep---*darn you rowdy teenage boys behind me!!* And seven hours into the flight, I started getting air sick? Is that a thing? I've never gotten nauseous from sitting on a plane, so that was a first.

### Traveling from KIX to ITM

After **landing in KIX**, we had to walk through the airport to first take the AirTrain (Is that what it's called here? I know that's what it's called at SFO...) to the customs area. I turned in the filled-out customs declaration form and other document that I received on the plane and arrived at the luggage carousel. 

Even inside the building, it was very humid! Fortunately, I kind of expected this and was dressed in breathable clothing. My body also didn't seem to mind the heat too much and my eczema stopped itching. Maybe it's because of my family's trip to the Philippines over winter break?

Because I sat towards the front of the plane, I didn't realize how many people were actually on-board my flight! Nor did I realize how much *stuff* everybody had---next time I make a trip like this, I'm going to try packing everything into a carry-on-sized luggage. `#minimalism`. 

I snatched my luggage and then walked to the customs officer waiting for me at the very end. When she asked me what my purpose for being in Japan was, I told her that I'll be studying in a program at Osaka University and showed her my acceptance documents. But even though I told her that my living situation was provided by the school, and gave her an address and the duration I would be staying there, she didn't seem very convinced. She also didn't believe that my passport wasn't actually mine! Does my haircut + glasses combo really make that big of a difference?

After bringing another officer to me, showing *all* the documents I printed out---including my departure flight information, and taking off my glasses to verify my identity, I was finally able to pass through. Yikes.

UCEAP gave me some instructions to follow once I arrived at the airport, so I

1. First withdrew money from the Seven Bank (7-11's) ATM
2. Set up my luggage to get it shipped to my dorm the next day (I guess that's today)
3. Purchased a ticket to transfer to ITM via Airport Limousine

For everything, people were overly hospitable! Lots of people also asked how I liked San Diego and congratulated me on being in an engineering program (I was wearing the UC San Diego Bioengineering t-shirt that I slept in the night before, whoops).

After handing the driver my bus ticket, I made the long trek to Osaka International Airport (75 minutes), and then walked to my hotel. By the time I reached my room in the **Toyoko Inn Osaka Itami Kuko**, I was so pooped that I clocked out face-planted into the bed. (I was able to wake up seven hours later to shower and whatnot, but I was *so* exhausted from being awake for so long.)

I'll be posting all the pictures I've been taking in one of the next few posts! But it's time for me to head for my orientation at the university!
