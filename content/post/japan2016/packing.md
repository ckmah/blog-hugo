After finishing up my last few finals (Algorithms, Biochemical Techniques, and Cell Biology---*oh my!*), I have some down time to finalize what I'm packing for Japan! My flight leaves at 6:00am tomorrow from SFO, so I really hope that I'm not going to forget anything[^1]. 

To be honest, I think the hardest thing to pack are my clothes---everything else is relatively straight forward.

If one thing's for sure, I'm going to be taking along my Sony ILCE-A6000[^2], along with a **Mamiya-Sekor f/3.5 50mm Lens with ZE/NEX converter**, and the kit lens, a **Sony E f/3.5-5.6 OSS 16-55mm Lens**. I plan to look for more used SLR lenses at hobby shops---but in terms of more "modern" AF types, it'd be nice to get:

* Sony E f/1.8 OSS 35mm --- in my dreams because it's so expensive, but I'd like to have a fast prime to use
* Sigma f/2.8 35mm NEX --- an alternative to the Sony prime lens
* Sigma f/2.8 19mm NEX --- a pancake lens for a smaller kit.

Then, I'll also be taking my laptop to work on, as well as my tablet. Finally, since I'll be getting a SIM card from the school, I'll be bringing along my phone as well. To carry things, I'll be taking along the **Loft of Cambie Urban Pack**, a field bag that my friend got me from their Kickstarter campaign to use as a camera bag, a purse for when I go out in formal clothes, and my school backpack for when I go to work.

I also packed a few gifts that I purchased from the UC San Diego bookstore to give to my research mentor, and other people that I might meet abroad.

My mom has been telling me to pack a lot of clothes, but I'm planning to look over everything again tonight to make sure that I don't overpack too much. Right now, my luggage feels too heavy for me to move around!

I'll be posting again---with pictures, probably---when I land at my layover in Vancouver!

[^1]: As a side note, I also the **Minolta 1:1.8 55mm Lens with MD/NEX Adapter** that I ordered from Ebay just came in! The sample pictures that I've taken so far are unbelievably gorgeous. Unfortunately, this beaut will not be coming with me on my travels, but I plan to use it more next school year.

[^2]: I'll be bringing along my Sony ILCE-A6000 with me on the trip instead of my Nikon D5100 because of how much lighter it is--I plan to make it my go-to camera for the future as well.
