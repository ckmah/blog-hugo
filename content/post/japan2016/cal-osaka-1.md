Last weekend was one of the best weekends I've had in Japan so far! A few of my friends were in Japan from California, so I was able to rendezvous with their group to join them on a few adventures. The majority of the group had just graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, so I'm going to tag these next few posts with Cal@Osaka---there was a lot that went on!

### Friday, June 24th 

After listening to a research seminar at work, I quickly made my way to **Dotonburi** to meet up with my friends. I had never been to that area before, so it was very exciting to walk with the massive crowd to this iconic area. Everywhere I looked, there were shops, food stalls, and lots of people from different places! I'll try to definitely go again on my own time so I can take better pictures---most of these might be blurry because I was trying to get from place to place with everybody else. We had a group of 11 people!

In order to try and coordinate where to meet, people would drop pins of their location in our Facebook group chat. Even though the location wasn't the most accurate all the time, having everybody huddled together was always easy to spot. Luckily, it wasn't raining when we were walking around!

Here's a picture of on-top of the bridge that passes over the river. Next time I come here, I'll be sure to take pictures from the sides with better exposure settings! The entire area is completely bright at night because of all the screens and lights from shops. The other side that I took a picture of was too blurry, but there's a huge display of the Gilco man that lots of people take selfies in front of. I'll have to take one of myself soon!

A Gyu-kaku! I want to see how it tastes here compared to back home! I'll definitely have to come back sometime in the future. But compared to the other places in this area, Gyu-kaku is on the pricier end of the spectrum (to be honest, given the prices at home, I wasn't *that* surprised).

When in Osaka, it's important to grab some **takoyaki**, a snack made of a wheat-flour based batter, diced octopus, pickled ginger, green onions, and tempura scraps! I was able to snag a boat with 10 pieces for only 400 yen to share with a friend. It was so hot I burnt my tongue, but it was totally worth. I also want to try **okonomiyaki** that isn't cooked at a restaurant next time I'm here, as well as other types of street food! Everything is pretty well priced (definitely cheaper than the street food they have at Asian night markets back home), and it fills you up a decent amount. I had four pieces of takoyaki and I was already pretty full...

...but not full enough! I grabbed a beef bowl from **Yoshinoya** to create a full meal for dinner. Compared to the Yoshinoya joints back home, it's *much* better here in Japan. When I was comparing the portion sizes and presentation, the kids meal in Japan is more like what one purchases in the States.

This food truck sold *freshly baked* **melonpan**! And you could also purchase it with ice cream! Melonpan is a type of sweet bun that is baked with a thin layer of cookie dough on top. When it is fresh, it is very, very soft with a slightly crunchy top---and with ice cream, it's so good!

Finally, after cruising around and grabbing dinner, most of us went to a karaoke joint. It started off pretty expensive per hour (around 1300 yen), but the lady was very enthusiastic about us staying longer so she kept bumping down the price! We just stood there and she kept bringing the price lower and lower and lower. At the end, it all was pretty cheap to book the room for our group of eight, and it also included free non-alcoholic drinks!

Fortunately, the "controller" to select songs from could be easily navigated---we were able to select a bunch of English songs to sing, as well as a few Anime openings that people knew.

There was a **taiyaki** stand right outside the train station, so I got one for the train ride home. It wasn't as fluffy as I anticipated and was more crunchy and filled to the brim with red bean paste.

When our time was up, we all headed back to the AirBnB that the group had booked. I wasn't able to take pictures of the inside, but we had three floors to ourselves and an elevator inside the unit! The walk home was super pretty because of all the street lights, but it was also very empty. Nobody was really outside except for us, and I could no longer hear people shouting for you to purchase their goods or visit their shops.
