Before I move onto the first day of orientation, I've included the photos that I took yesterday! I didn't take a lot because I was pretty tired---my goal is to take lots and lots of pictures, and get into the habit of taking them! But maybe not editing them because that takes too long.

I honestly can't get over how beautiful this airport was, yet so lush. Actually, it kind of looked like a mall? Especially with all of the duty free shops. SFO in comparison has that "modernism", metallic feel, while this one is more homey.

A picture from the inside of the limousine bus that I took to travel between two of the major airports in Osaka; it was a 75 minute trip! I found out that usually locals use ITM while more international folk fly in through KIX. KIX is also in the middle of the water? On an island-type thing?

### Traveling to Osaka University's Minoh Campus

Right after completing the previous post, I immediately started making my way towards the Osaka Minoh campus for the first day of orientation!

To my surprise, it wasn't very difficult to travel by train because all of the maps and signs are clearly labeled. Compared to BART or the LA or Washington DC Metro trains, the transportation here is a lot more clear regarding where you're going and how to get there. Trains are also accurate **to the second**!

While taking the **Osaka Monorail**, I travelled from the **Osaka Airport** to **Bampaku-kinen-koen** and then hopped onto the train to **Saito-nishi** Station. In order to pay for everything, I used my Pasmo IC card that my friend from the States told me to get before I came---it's like a Clipper or Metro card!

Right after I got off at my final stop, I went to a convenience store to grab something to eat---I had some food before I left the hotel, but it wasn't enough, unfortunately. I also needed to get some coins to use for vending machines if I ever need to use one.

The tricky part was actually getting to the school! I had directions to walk past the convenience store with certain landmarks to the right and left of me, but some of these descriptions were sort of inaccurate. I relied a lot on an app I downloaded while still at school: **maps.me**[^1]. 

[^1]: Basically, with the app, you can download maps offline of entire cities, and then get walking and driving directions to locations of your choice. The maps that are used are derived from an open source website where populating landmarks, etc. are crowdsourced. You can also bookmark locations and classify them for your own future reference! If you're ever traveling, I _really_ suggest that you use it! They support a bunch of different locations, and the maps are very well populated---I tested it out with Google Maps, a few downloaded maps of areas I visited in the Philippines, and a map of the San Francisco Bay area. <br><br> The only downside is that lots of the titles of places are in Japanese, which can be difficult to translate; I work around this by using Google Translate's new _"immediately-translate-when-you-copy-something-to-the-clipboard"_ function. Additionally, there aren't any public transit directions---I have to rely on other apps for those, and most of them rely on having Wi-Fi or Data signal due to the large amount of information.

To get around everywhere, I've been using **maps.me** (with my phone in `Airplane` mode, and the `GPS` and `Wi-Fi` functions turned on) and a few train maps and apps that I downloaded while I still had signal. So in order to find my way back to the school, I looked for the locations that were mentioned in the instructions and followed the roads from there! The entrance that the school wanted me to enter through was kind of hard to find---there was supposed to be a sign, but the sign was written on a piece of paper in Japanese taped to the fence.

> Something that I really love about this area is that it's packed with greenery! Then again, it is raining a lot. There's moss at every corner, and trees everywhere! I also appreciate the humidity---my skin is so happy and hydrated, compared to how dry it is in the States.

Finally, after walking past the tennis courts, and passing by a Filipino lady (who said hello to me in Tagalog, which put me at ease immediately), I finally made it to the **Center for Japanese Language and Culture** before the rain started coming down! 

### The Orientation

I ended up being the first person waiting for the orientation to start---an hour early, but it was because I was paranoid about getting there on time without knowing the transit systems, etc. Our schedule for this first day of orientation was as follows:

* UCEAP - General Overview of the Program 
* UCEAP - Surface-level Cultural Differences between Japan and the US
* Lunch and Socializing
* UCEAP - How to Maintain One's Health
* UCEAP - Academic Aspects of the Program
* Osaka University - SIM Card Payment 
* Osaka University - Logistical Information
* Osaka University - Dormitory Orientation

_Yeah, that's a lot of stuff._

I was able to talk with quite a few of the people in my program, and everybody seems to be very nice! Additionally, people are also **extremely passionate** about science and research---this is exactly the environment that I'm really looking forward to being a part of!

We got *a lot* of material to look over and try to understand. Lots of the slides towards the end of the presentation said things like "Mandatory to Complete This Task by Tomorrow", etc.

The program seems very tough, but I think it will be fun and rewarding at the end. The only thing I'm very concerned about is the fact that our efforts are graded---it's worth 12 units! So depending on how my grade is in this program, my GPA can either tank or barely rise. (A's don't really help you *that* much, unfortunately.)

---

<img src="/img/japan2016/02_lunch.JPG" alt="Orientation Documents" style="max-width: 100%; flexbox;"/>

Fooooooood! There was a buffet lunch! We were each given small plates---honestly, the plates were the size of my fist---but the food was very filling and delicious.

Generally, all of the students are enthusiastic to learn new things while having fun at the same time. But during introductions and talking about our involvements in student organizations, classes, etc., I was called a competitive applicant by some of the other students? Which feels weird because I feel like I'm far behind the pack.

On the first day, I ended up paying so much money for things like an umbrella to use, a SIM card to allow my phone to access the web without Wi-Fi (I'm so happy I unlocked my phone prior to coming here), a few passes on the train line, and a few supplies to use in my dormitory. I still need to purchase a bath towel to use after I shower---all I have right now is my hand towel.

I'm excited for the program, well, still excited. But that excitement is slowly going away as I realize how much work this summer is going to be. It'll be worth it, right?
