I've just been working on some tasks in lab---nothing too exciting! I analyzed my statistical data from the past week and started compiling a new powerpoint with what I've been working on; because I need to make a presentation at the end of my program, I want to document everything as I go! That way, when I need to make that final presentation, everything has already been mostly compiled.

With this internship, I've gained the following skills thus far:

* Making SQL queries
* Familiarity with PostgreSQL/psql
* Bash scripting

I hope to add more to this list as I go along!

Without further ado, here's a continuation of last weekend's adventure update! I'm going to be going on a class field trip on Friday, so I want to finish documenting last weekend, senior photographs (my hard drive has officially run out of space so I can't do much until I purchase a new one, oh dear), and other things *soon*!

### Saturday, June 25th

After we spent time in Osaka, we were out and about to head to **Kinosakionsen** to get some rest and relaxation---and delicious food! [Kinosaki](http://www.kinosaki-spa.gr.jp/global/) is mainly known for their hot springs and crabs, and I definitely recommend going to anybody that's interested. Next time I go, I want to go with friends (that are female) so I'm not sitting by myself in the hot spring. I mean, it's nice to get some "alone"---not really alone because it's a public bath---time, but I was jealous of all the girls who were talking to their friends.

I didn't get that many photos of the train ride coming to Kinosaki, but the train car was *extremely* empty. And once we got to the town? It was so, so quiet---there aren't any large cities nearby, so all you hear is the sound of the breeze rustling the wind chimes, yourself breathing, and the faint noises of people talking around you.

Because my group split up into two caravans, I waited with my group at the tourist information center for a little bit before we left to go eat lunch. Surprisingly, there was a non-Japanese lady at the counter that spoke perfect English, so it was easy to get directions on where to grab food, what to check out later in the evening, etc.

The town itself was pretty empty and quiet, but I really liked it! We were standing on the side of town without that many hot springs---there were mostly tourist shops with souvenirs, tiny eateries, and some small hotels here and there. There wasn't any sidewalks, but there weren't that many cars either. Sometimes, we saw people walking around in **yukatas**!

This drinking water was very, I guess you could say, salty? And it was super hot? Personally, I wouldn't recommend drinking it.

I ordered a bowl of rice with crab tempura and miso soup! It was super filling and delicious, but kind of expensive.

Crab cream croquette that my friend got! Apparently it was more cream than crab.

Finally, when the other group met up with us, we made our way to the **ryokan**! The place we reserved was on the outskirts of town and we had to take a shuttle bus to get there from the train station---it was a short drive, but by walking, it would take approximately 45 minutes. Next time, I'll definitely try to stay closer to all of the **onsens**.

---

After arriving at the hotel, showing our passports to the manager, and finishing all the administration stuff for check-in, we each chose a **yukata** to wear! 

Or at least, I did. The girls have a *very* wide selection to choose from, whereas the boys had only one option for their design and three options for sizes: medium, large, and extra large. In this picture, you can kind of see the men's options in the distance? But there are so many colors and patterns for girls to choose from!

<img src="/img/japan2016/11_room.JPG" style="max-width: 100%; flexbox;"/>

I was able to snap a picture of the room that we would be staying in! There aren't any "Western-style" beds because we had futons to sleep on. I wasn't able to take a picture of those (by the time it was time to go to bed I was pooped), but they were pretty comfortable.

---

Finally, after touring around a few of the onsens, we made our way back to the hotel for dinner. Everything was beautifully plated and I felt bad eating everything that was placed in front of me because I didn't want to ruin the handiwork. We stayed at the dinner table for a little over two hours because we had so much to eat!

When we walked into the room, *this* is what we saw prepared for us: the appetizer. It was super pretty that people were hesitant to start eating.

I mean...

---

<img src="/img/japan2016/11_course1-2.JPG" style="max-width: 100%; flexbox;"/>

...look at...

---

<img src="/img/japan2016/11_course1-1.JPG" style="max-width: 100%; flexbox;"/>

...this food!

The appetizer was a bunch of small dishes all geared around seafood. To be honest, I don't remember what some of the stuff I was eating was called, but it tasted good. A lot of it was seafood mixed with another component. My favorite item was the lightly-fried crab claw because it was warm and I was feeling a little chilly.

A picture of everybody I was traveling with! Notice how tiny I look in the back, and how my yukata is a different pattern from everybody else.

<img src="/img/japan2016/11_sashimi.JPG" style="max-width: 100%; flexbox;"/>

The next dish was sashimi! The tuna was the best! And with this meal, I also learned that I'm not the biggest fan of raw shrimp---sorry shrimp.

---

<img src="/img/japan2016/11_steak3.JPG" style="max-width: 100%; flexbox;"/>

The next meal after that was steak! They gave us a hot plate to cook everything on to our liking! I cooked everything so it was still a little pink on the inside, and paired it with the sweet sauce they gave us. Sweet and savory---delicious! Each hot plate was shared between four people, so our group caramelized our onions and let them stay on the plate for a long time. The roasted pepper was also pretty good!

<img src="/img/japan2016/11_fish3.JPG" style="max-width: 100%; flexbox;"/>

Our next course was fish soup! What was cool about this meal was that they took the fish, partially cooked, and finished cooking it in front of us with some hot water they poured on top. After closing the lid and letting it sit for ten minutes or so, we could finally start eating! The broth wasn't too watery or too fishy! At this point, we were all pretty stuffed, but the fish wasn't too filling.

There were a few people in our group that didn't know how to eat fish with the bones still on it, so that was kind of amusing to watch them try to figure out how to do.

I'm not a fan of eating fish eyes, but one guy was super into them.

Finally, we ended our two-hour meal with some dessert: vanilla panna cotta with fruits and a simple syrup!

---

After dinner, all of us were pretty exhausted and didn't want to go back to town (only by walking because the busses stopped running at this point). We travelled to the baths inside the hotel, and then played a game of BANG! in one of the rooms before people went to bed.

I really want to try going again to this place in the future. It's relaxing, laid back, and I was able to lose all the tension in my shoulders by sinking into the water. I also was able to spend some time in the outdoor bath by myself because it was getting pretty late. Surprisingly, I didn't get cold at all, and I wasn't too bothered by the fact that you had to be nude in front of everybody else---it felt really embarrassing at first, but when I realized that nobody really cared, then I felt more comfortable.
