The first night in my room was kind of scary. I kept waking up at night thinking that I was at home, but I would toss and turn and hit my forehead on the desk.

That wasn't fun. 

But I like the idea of having my own single!  

So today was the second day of orientation---this time, it was an orientation specific to the research program. We learned a little about the university from the program coordinator, as well as the basis of the university's educational program. Basically, in their fourth year of studying, students move on to work in an assigned research laboratory to complete their **Bachelor's Thesis**. After this, they have the option of pursuing a **Masters Program** for two years, and then a **Doctorate Program** after that for three more years. After learning more about the program, we were picked up by our lab research mentors and brought to our desks to do work.

Before meeting with my mentor, there was a mix-up! There are two Michelle's in my program, and the mentor for the other Michelle picked me up and took me to their lab before we recognized the mix-up. 

### The Laboratory for Protein Informatics

Once I got picked up by the graduate student I would be working with, I got an uneasy feeling: I already know that this summer is going to be very difficult. My mentoring professor is very busy and it is difficult to set up a meeting with him. Additionally, the majority of the members in the lab only speak Japanese---and if they speak English, it's kind of difficult for me to understand what idea they want to get across. My laboratory is very far in the north of campus as well.

To be honest, I'm very frustrated with myself for not being able to speak Japanese. I'm very disappointed in myself for not at least putting in the effort to try and join a language table, take a class, or even... 

I want to show that I'm eager to learn, that I want to be a *competent* and valuable member of their team. It's hard to do so when there's a language barrier that prevents me from getting the computer or Wi-Fi password. I don't want to completely do this alone---I need some direction to start off with so that I can produce good results!

I'm going to email the professor again to see if we can set up a designated meeting time, or try to work something out so I can at least *complete* this summer, and do something. So far, I'm kind of disappointed with the place I've been assigned to.

#### My goals for this weekend: 

1. Read a few of the professor's research papers and things that his lab has done---perhaps print these items out? Put them on my computer and annotate them?
2. Email him and ask for materials to look for to start driving my project forward.
3. Try to learn basic phrases in Japanese and speak with somebody, and practice!
4. Destress somehow. 
5. Fill out the necessary UCEAP forms to tell them that I'm meeting up with friends next weekend (not this coming weekend) with friends from the States
