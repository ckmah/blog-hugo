The first night in my room was kind of scary. I kept waking up at night thinking that I was at home, but I would toss and turn and hit my forehead on the desk.

That wasn't fun. 

But I like the idea of having my own single!

I woke up pretty early to try and take pictures, grab breakfast, and go to the orientation, so this is a picture of the lobby of the dormitory where I will be staying this summer. I really want to get to know people, but I'm too scared at times to try and talk to them when they're a large group and they're all having fun.

There's a park in the neighborhood that I cut through to save five minutes on walking to both the train station and the school! Walking to the school in total is about 2 miles, which is a decent walk, but considering how warm it's getting and how rainy it might be in the next few days, I kind of don't want to make the trek.

The train stations here are pretty big! It feels like when I go to Yamada Station, that I'm visiting the Powell Street BART Station in San Francisco! Maybe it's because there's an attached shopping complex. There's also a UNIQLO there!

So today was the second day of orientation---this time, it was an orientation specific to the research program. We learned a little about the university from the program coordinator, as well as the basis of the university's educational program. Basically, in their fourth year of studying, students move on to work in an assigned research laboratory to complete their **Bachelor's Thesis**. After this, they have the option of pursuing a **Masters Program** for two years, and then a **Doctorate Program** after that for three more years. 

Right before the end of the orientation, I received my JASSO scholarship money as well as signed up for a research study! I'm trying to accumulate as much money as I can to, well, save money on this trip but still have room to pay for things such as dinner and adventures that I may have. Finally, we were picked up by our lab research mentors and brought to our desks to get settled!

Before meeting with my mentor, there was a mix-up! There are two Michelle's in my program, and the mentor for the other Michelle picked me up and took me to their lab before we recognized the mix-up. 

### The Laboratory for Protein Informatics, Institute for Protein Research

There was kind of a mix-up when I was first acclimating to my lab---because I don't speak any Japanese, it's kind of hard to communicate with everybody here. People are very nice and welcoming! But I really wish I spoke their language instead of relying on them to know mine. The plus side is that I'm picking up on a lot of phrases, so maybe once I get to courage to actually speak, I can talk with them more easily. Not conversationally! But just barely enough.

My assigned professor is very busy at the moment because he's chairing a seminar! So I got assigned to a new professor in the meantime that he collaborates with! A lot of the materials I was given are related to PDBj, the protein database in Japan that handles a lot of the data submitted from Asia---it's like the RCSB PDB that's headquartered in the San Diego area. It seems like I'll be relying a lot on email, so I think as long as I'm proactive with trying to contact them when I have questions and fully digesting the material, I'll be fine.

I hope to contribute as much as I can and more, as well as learn a lot from this experience.

### The Commute

Now that I've finally been assigned my research location, I can figure out my commute every morning! I'll be taking the **Hankyu Railway** to get from **Kita-senri** station to **Yamada** station. I'll be paying 300 yen every day to get to work, and in total, that'd be (at a minimum) 10,800 yen!

A picture of the railway map! I'm starting to get used to the train system here---it makes me kind of scared to take the train by myself, but everything is organized enough where I can find my way around.

I'm really happy that the **Kita-senri** station has an attached 100 Yen shop to it! I was able to purchase goods that I needed---like laundry supplies (which I plan to do next week because my load is pretty small right now). 

Tomorrow, I'm planning to go to Osaka Station with a few friends that I made in the program, so I'm super excited for that! I also need to convert my JR Rail Pass to the *actual* rail pass so I can meet up with friends next weekend and travel to Kinosaki.

*I'm really sorry that I haven't been updating as frequently as the day of sometimes! I need to figure out a better workflow for updating this blog. I also need to continue editing senior photos and whatnot---gah, there's a whole lot to do! Maybe I'll work on it more today---the date is actually Saturday, June 18th here, but I initialized this post yesterday on the 17th.*
