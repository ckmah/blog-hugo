I've just been coming to work and whatnot, so I haven't had a chance to blog as much as I would like! But, here's a mass post with what I've been up to the past few days!

### Sunday, June 19th

After an exhausting weekend and several days, I decided that it was finally time to delve into my project and get some work done. To be completely honest, I'm really glad that I was able to join BMES and become an officer---being a part of that community really helped me develop the social skills that I needed to talk with others and whatnot. Everybody has really cool stories that they have to share! 

On Sunday, I went to **Osaka University's Science and Engineering Library** with two of the people I met through the program I'm in to read several of the papers that were given to me by my mentor and digest how to make basic SQL queries. Beforehand, we grabbed lunch at the **Dew Shopping Center** at the **Hankyu Railway's Yamada Station**!

I ordered a rice dish with fried pork steak and marinara sauce! The yellow topping is a cheese/mustard sauce! Even though I'm *not* a fan of mustard, this dish was very delicious. Something that I've noticed here is that the portion sizes are decently sized: it's either perfect where I'm neither hungry nor too full, or it's enough so that I'm very full after eating a huge portion but could eat more food afterwards after standing for a bit!

---

After eating began the long trek to the library---which is conveniently located near my laboratory. We took the train to **Hankyu Railway's Kita-Senri Station** and then walked on and then through the campus. From the maps, the campus looks very large! But when you're actually weaving through the buildings, things aren't so bad---I think that the size is either smaller or comparable to UCSD. The difference, however, is that the buildings are larger I think. Maybe it's the abundance of trees that's giving off that impression?

Regardless, after this trip, I think I'll have gained some muscle from walking  several miles and a portion of that uphill! I think I'm also losing weight from the exercise in the heat!

We hung out in the library's left wing near all the computers! Back home, I don't really go the library much---I either study in the Bioengineering Building or at more populated areas---and here I don't really plan on going to the library to do work. Libraries are too quiet for my taste! I like having noise in the background? This library in particular reminded me of the 8th floor of Geisel Library!

A picture of the path I take to get to and from the station to campus every morning and afternoon. There are lots and lots of trees everywhere! The shade is very nice to have, especially when it's bright and sunny out. And the cover is also nice to have when it's raining really hard. It's really pretty here! I think I wouldn't mind living here, especially compared to California because of how dry it is there in comparison.

### Monday, June 20th

Monday was my first *real* day at work! I also was able to meet with my research mentor for the first time, as well as receive my project! 

My research mentor is very nice to talk to---either in person or over email---especially because he doesn't seem to mind making smalltalk and because he's very prompt when answering my questions. His English is very good, and he's able to follow when I speak at natural speed, which is a huge plus for me when trying to communicate scientific ideas. I'm still very intimidated by him due to this track record, but he's a nice guy[^1].

[^1]: I'm also really glad that he didn't make any comment about my name (Michelle, a non-asian name) and the fact that I was Asian. He also didn't make any comments about the fact that I'm very tan for an Asian person, and didn't make any weird comments about how I'm supposedly an "accomplished Filipino". I know stereotypes are everywhere, and that I should have anticipated them more when coming in, but it was refreshing to meet with somebody that didn't make them plainly obvious. 

To start off the program, my mentor wanted to assess my abilities and see what I am capable of. Because the lab I'm working with deals with the **Protein Database in Japan ([PDBj](http://pdbj.org/))**, I'll be working with the data that's contained within to start off the summer. Because I have no experience with SQL or database-anything for that matter, I'm very scared about if I'll be able to meet the expectations that have been bestowed upon me by my mentor, as well as the program.

The entryway to my workplace! There are so many trees everywhere! As you can see on the right, there are cubbies for people to place their shoes (which have been outdoors) and exchange them for indoor shoes. My laboratory doesn't have indoor shoes so I don't have to use those cubbies, but a lot of people do use them. There's also a place for people to store wet umbrellas and their bikes on the left side. My laboratory is on the fourth floor, so I take the elevator to get there!

The area around my laboratory is nice! And there's a conveniently located Seven-Eleven around the corner where I go to grab food and drinks when I'm hungry around lunchtime. I'm amazed by how *orderly* people are here. People neatly stand in a single-file line---usually to the right side to let busy people pass through the left---and never get too distracted to hold up any queue. Even though the queue to purchase my food might be 20-persons long, it still takes me only five minutes to (i) line up, (ii) pay for my food, (iii) heat it up in the provided microwave. 

The only problem is that because the combini is fairly small and tightly-packed, I feel pressured to make a selection then get out as fast as possible!

Food for lunch! Chicken with rice, and an egg on the side! Even though this meal looks fairly small, it fills me up for a few hours.

### Tuesday, June 21st

Another day of lab! On Tuesday, I was able to finish a chunk of my project---albeit in the most *inefficient* way possible---and send it to my mentor. I can see from my email client (I'm using [Nylas](https://nylas.com/) if anybody's interested) that he's opened the email, but since he's traveling right now, I'm going to work on optimizing my code, as well as working on the second portion of my assignment to pass the time.

I guess you can say that it's same-old, same-old already: come to work, do a chunk of the work assigned, go home.

My desk in lab---it's pretty sweet. It's a 27-inch Retina iMac with fully loaded specs! A lot of the people here do visualization of proteins and other things, so having the good specs is a huge plus. For me, I'm not doing anything too intensive yet---I've been using it to read papers. I hope to use it to its full potential this summer though!

---

The only difference for Tuesday compared to Monday was that a few of my friends from California---the group that I'm going with to visit Kinosaki this weekend---came in from Tokyo from the **shinkansen**, otherwise known as the bullet train! They'll be staying over in Osaka for the next few days, and because the commute there is fairly inexpensive (it's about $4.00 round trip for me), I plan to visit them when I can during the evenings!

Because I finished a chunk of my work, and because I came in earlier than the rest of my lab mates, I left early to meet up with my friends for dinnertime and to explore the area. I took the train from the **Hankyu Railway's Kita-Senri Station** to **Umeda Station**! From there, I walked to the **Grand Hotel Osaka**---a huge building filled with offices, eateries, clothing stores, and more! 

---

<img src="/img/japan2016/07_mojito.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; flexbox;"/>

For dinner, we had **okonomiyaki**! The place we went to required that we each pay for a food item, for a drink (alcoholic or non-alcoholic), and for a portion of the cover charge. Having to pay so much (to American standards, this place was pretty cheap considering everything) kind of sucked but the food tasted very good. I ordered the **Special Order Okonomiyaki** that had octopus, potato, beef, squid, and a bunch of other stuff, with a **mojito**---being of legal age is kind of awesome.

After we explored the mall for a bit, I made my trek back home and still got back at a decent enough time to look over some stuff for work! 

Right now, I'm at work doing stuff that my mentor told me to look over, but I hope to meet again with the California group tonight. On Thursday, I also was able to make plans with people from my program to go to Karaoke! Between having to do straight research and exploring the area, I'm going to be really sad at the end when I have to leave.

Here's a picture of Yamada Station at night! I wish I was carrying around my camera---I tend not to bring it to work.
