So yesterday I hung out at the Osaka and Umeda Stations (they are next door to each other) with more people from the **FrontierLab@OsakaU Program** by using the **Hankyu Railway**! I'm so glad that there's a train stop that is located near my dormitory!

The area around the mall is a residential area! There are lots of apartment buildings and houses everywhere! I really wish I could see the inside of the apartments that are around here, just to compare the size with my future apartment for next school year back in the States. Also, the Yamada Train station is one of the stops on the Hankyu-Senri's Local train line.

On the way to Umeda Station, I took the wrong train and got lost somewhere. Compared to the other stations I've been to, this one was more industrial-looking? I know I was supposed to get off at Awaji, but that didn't pan out as planned! When they arrive at certain stations, the trains convert into a different line---because I can't understand that portion when they state it on the intercom (I can finally understand what stop we're going to and whatnot---the key? Listen for the names) it makes it difficult for me to know whether to stay on or not.

One of the things I saw in a Seven-Eleven connected to the Umeda Station! Seeing anime figurines and other merchandise everywhere makes me really happy.

Right after I arrived at Umeda Station, I had to go to Osaka Station to convert my JR Rail Pass! Because I'll be taking JR trains to get to Kinosaki next weekend, I needed to convert my pass to be usable on certain dates.

I wanted to take pictures of the area, so I arrived at the station a little bit earlier than the rest of my group! As well as explore **Yobadashi Camera**'s Umeda branch! I've only heard about it through internet forums---like the ones on [Digital Photography Review](http://www.dpreview.com/)---but I was really excited to see all of the different camera lenses they had in stock! And also the prices for Sony E-Mount lenses I can use as a walk-around prime!

Look at how massive the store is! There's not just camera stuff at this store! There are restaurants and cafes, nail salons, massage parlors, clothing sections to the store, home appliances---literally *everything* that you could need! I don't know how the prices compare to other places, but this place was bustling with people! Imagine a mall, but packed into a single store!

After walking around the store for a good hour or so, I walked back to meet my friends at Umeda Station. This station is connected to the **Lucua Shopping Center**, a 10 story giant that's filled with areas to shop for clothing, as well as purchase food. 

Finding the store a little too girly and high-end, we walked over to the **Daimaru Umeda Department Store** next to Osaka Station to visit the **Osaka Pokemon Center**!

A few of us were a little hungry, so we looked around Lucua's food court before leaving. Everything looked so good!

We were honestly extremely, extremely excited to enter the Pokemon Center!

All of the plushies on display everywhere were so cute! There were so many areas dedicated to just Pikachu! However, things were more on the pricey side---or, I guess you could say normal for a themed store. Why can't we have these in the States?

Literally, this was the most intense thing going on at the store: a TCG match between an elementary schooler and one of the store's employees. There was even a commentator speaking extremely fast---I assume he was dictating each move and commenting on the possible strategies each player had. The kids were also cheering the boy on!

I wasn't able to grab a clear enough picture of the inside of the Pokemon Center's Union Room, but there were kids and adults inside trading their cards. People were given trays to put down whatever they wanted to trade, and they would swap it with the person in front of them when the lady at the front of the closed-off area yelled something into the microphone.

---

After helping the boys of the group shopping for a bit at the UNIQLO next door to the Pokemon Center, we were all pretty hungry. The top floor of the building had lots of areas to sit-down and eat, so we walked around trying to decide what to try.

We wanted to eat at one of the cafes that served omurice, but got confused in the location and ended up eating at an Itallian eatery instead! I ordered spaghetti carbonara!

All of the food displays always look so delicious!

At the end of the day, all of us were pretty full from our dinner, exhausted from trying to find things and getting confused on where to go, and sore from walking a lot. But I think it was pretty worth it to explore! I'll have to go again a few more times to try and check out the station, as well as the surrounding area. Osaka has a good food scene and I fully intend to go check it out!

This is what greeted us when we exited the building! The sky was so pretty and my camera didn't do it much justice---next time we get another shot like this, I'll try and edit it to what you could actually see. It was breathtakingly gorgeous and the weather was perfectly warm yet cool at the same time.

Walking back to the station---there are so many people!

I went on the same train with friends, but got off a little early to catch another connection that would go to Yamada Station. I ended up getting lost a few times and my battery died halfway through on my trek back home, but I was able to get back safely without anything happening! A group of high school boys helped me out when I asked one of them for help with reading the rail map.
